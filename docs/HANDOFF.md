# Where this leaves off — 2026-08-26

TIME SHATTER, live at **https://timeshatter.app**. Portrait-mobile
first-person arcade shooter, Superhot-descended. Development is
playtest-driven: the owner plays on an iPhone, reports what went wrong,
the change is measured rather than eyeballed, and it ships from this repo.

## Which repository — read this before anything else

**`onlinestuff4me-sketch/timeshard`, branch `main`, is the only home of
TIME SHATTER.** GitHub Pages serves timeshatter.app from its root: what is
on `main` is what players get. Every change belongs here and nowhere else.

**`onlinestuff4me-sketch/neon-grid-breaker` is a DIFFERENT GAME. Nothing to
do with TIME SHATTER goes into it.**

That repo used to be called `physics-arcade-game`, and for a long time this
game's work was mirrored into it as well. It has since been renamed and
repurposed. The trap is that **GitHub silently redirects git pushes to a
renamed repository**: a working copy whose remote still reads
`.../onlinestuff4me-sketch/physics-arcade-game` will push, report success,
and land the commits in `neon-grid-breaker` — where they are invisible to
anyone looking for this project, and mixed into a repo about something
else. That is exactly what happened; it went unnoticed for a whole session
because every push said it worked.

**So, concretely:**

* Clone or work in `timeshard`. Push to `timeshard`. Nothing else.
* If a session starts checked out somewhere whose `git remote -v` says
  `physics-arcade-game` — a path like `/home/user/physics-arcade-game` is
  the giveaway — that is the other game's repo. Do not push to it.
* There is nothing to migrate out of it. Checked file by file: every `src/`
  module and `index.html` were byte-identical to the copies here, and the
  only tracked file unique to it was `package-lock.json`.

> Container paths (`/home/user/...`, `/workspace/...`) are an artefact of
> whichever machine a session runs on and mean nothing to the person reading
> a handoff. Always name repositories.

**A deploy is confirmed by the GitHub Actions conclusion, never by the
push.** `mcp__github__actions_list` → `list_workflow_runs`, match the
head SHA, wait for `completed / success`.

> The session brief named `claude/superhot-mobile-portrait-wynhu2` as the
> development branch. This stream of work has lived on
> `claude/tunnel-focus-experiments` for many sessions and stayed there to
> avoid fragmenting it. Worth confirming which the owner wants.

## What shipped this session

Two rounds of playtest findings and one balance change.

**Round one — eight tutorial findings.** The divider line now comes and
goes with the DODGE cue. The dodge coach watches the FIRST round of each
leg and stops the world at 75% of its flight when the player is still
within 0.55 m of its line. Phantom spawns are gone: `spawnEnemy` bakes the
assemble into absolute world coordinates, and the onboarding was spawning
first and moving the body after, leaving 156 shards to converge on nobody
— median drift nine metres, now 2.4 cm. TRAINING COMPLETE is a headline
plus a sub-line. The "stray sound" after a leg's last shatter was the
leg's own door opening 30-80 m away at the volume of a door at your feet;
there is no distance rolloff anywhere in the sfx graph, so `airlock()`
takes a distance now. The off-screen arrow had one fixed angle against a
camera whose FOV moves 80° → 66°, with no hysteresis; it has two
thresholds derived from the live half-frame. And door 5's empty pillared
room turned out not to be a vault bug at all — see below.

**The distribution.** 71 of 71 vault legs fielded nobody in the room the
banner calls your only cover, and no leg of any kind had a share anywhere
before its last two stretches: a median 84% of every leg could not produce
an enemy. Two mechanisms, both correct code on a small input — `hallWave`
filled quota from the END (`want - back * per`, and `want` is 1-2), and
`spawnEnemy`'s finale guard was `spawnQueue.length < 3` against a measured
maximum queue of 2, so it was always true and every body went to the door.
Legs now come in three kinds: one that promises a PLACE reserves a body
for it, one that promises a QUALITY spreads down the corridor, one that
promises nothing is untouched (its `DOOR 7` is a fact, not a claim, and
the door group is a deliberate payoff). Cost: mean bodies per leg 1.34 →
1.48.

**Round two — five more.** Ammo readout moved off the weapon to the bottom
row. No firing while the dodge freeze holds the world. TRAINING COMPLETE
4200 ms. A leg's first body ignores the release window so a corridor is
never silent on arrival, and an empty leg's edge arrow points at the door.
TIME/SHATTER only when somebody is still standing.

**The ramp.** Telegraph tightness had its own 18-door schedule while
bullet speed climbed to door 98 — half the difficulty curve spent in the
first fifth of the game. `diffT()` now reads where the round's speed sits
between `SPEED.openM` and `SPEED.capM`, so both reach full heat together
on door 98 and telegraphs inherit the school's ten-door plateau.
**Doors 19-97 are easier than they were**: aim factor at door 19 went
0.52 → 1.06, at door 46 → 0.85. `RAMP.rampWaves` is gone, slider and all.

**Round three — first sight, and the menu.** Every distance check measured
from where the player STANDS, and a corridor jogs: a body 9 m away round a
corner is 3 m from where you'll be when you can see him — and placement
prefers hidden spots on purpose. Now `firstSightDist()` walks the leg's
spine, finds the first point with a line to the candidate, and measures
there; `EARLY.firstSightM` is 13 m, flat through door 10, eased away by
door 18. Where nothing qualifies, nobody spawns and the body goes back on
the queue. Applies only to the corridor's own paced release. Measured
worst first sight in doors 1-10: 13.09 m; with the rule removed, 3.39 m
and a straight-line zero.

Menu: overlay cards scroll (the saves card never had `max-height`, and a
flex-centred overflowing card is cut off at BOTH ends, so CLOSE was below
the bottom of the phone and reloading was the only way out); the dimmed
ground closes them; RECOVERED SO FAR is the union of every save plus the
live run; and NEW RUN starts a new run — at the cap the oldest save with
no doors behind it gives way.

## NEXT UP — the playtest that closed this session

Five things, reported with screenshots after the last deploy. None is
started; all of them are described here in enough detail to act on.

### 1. The direction arrow needs to be one clear thing, not a flicker

**What was seen:** the small red arrow appears and disappears seemingly at
random while walking the training hallway, and when it is up it collides
with the lesson's own words (it landed on DRAG TO MOVE).

**What is wanted:** while the player is being led somewhere — the whole
early game — ONE larger, unmistakable arrow that reads as a compass
needle rotating in space, pointing the way to go, placed so it never
obstructs the messaging. The small per-enemy markers are for LATER, once
rooms hold several enemies and the player has learned what the marks mean.
So: one big "go this way" arrow now, small "somebody is over there" marks
introduced later.

**Where:** `updateEdgeArrows()` in `src/main.js` (it builds `.edgearrow`
divs on a ring of `min(vw,vh) * 0.38` and points them by rotation);
`.edgearrow` CSS at `index.html:47`; thresholds `EDGE_ARROW_SHOW` 0.94 /
`EDGE_ARROW_HIDE` 0.72 of the camera's live half-frame. The door fallback
— arrow to the door when a leg is empty — is inside the same function.
The flicker the player still sees is most likely the door arrow and the
enemy arrows trading places, not the hysteresis, which is measured good in
`edgesnd.js`.

### 2. The spurious arrow on entering a room

**What was seen:** walking into a new training room, a direction arrow
flashes for about a second and vanishes. It reads as a bug and it is not
needed — the player is already in the room.

**Cause:** almost certainly the door fallback added this session. On the
frame you cross in, the leg has no bodies yet, so the arrow points at the
door until the opener spawns. Suppress it for a beat after a crossing, or
require the leg to have been quiet for a moment first.

### 3. The ammo pips need the readout's own shadow

**What was seen:** PISTOL is legible against a light floor; the pips
beside it are not.

**Where:** `#ammo` carries `text-shadow: 0 1px 10px rgba(238,240,243,.9),
0 0 2px rgba(238,240,243,.75)` — a TEXT shadow, which does nothing for the
pips because they are `background`-filled elements, not glyphs
(`index.html:105`). They want the same halo: `filter: drop-shadow(...)` on
`#ammo .mag`, or a matching `box-shadow` on `.pip`.

### 4. The training ramp should be three rooms, not six

**What is wanted**, after the STAND HERE barrier and the dodge/shoot
lessons: one enemy in a hallway, then two enemies in a hallway, then three
enemies in a room with pillars, then training ends and Door 1 begins.

**Where:** `src/tutorial.js` — `LEGS` currently runs `room1` (vault, 1),
`hall1` (corridor, 1), `room2` (vault, 2), `hall2` (corridor, 2), `room3`
(vault, 3), `hall3` (corridor, 3) at lines 303-325, with `STEPS` entries
`ramp1`..`ramp6` to match. That is six areas where three are asked for,
and it alternates room/hall where the ask is hall, hall, room. Cutting it
means the leg list, the step list, and the tool's TUTORIAL pane, which
reads both. `tutool.js` lints cue/grant agreement and will catch a step
whose cues no longer have a leg.

### 5. Confirm with the owner

Whether the archive should span game modes (it does now — discovery is
treated as the player's, not the save's) or track each mode separately.
One line in `discoverData()`.

## Open from before, in the order I would take them

1. **Play the opening doors.** The first-sight rule means a tight winding
   early leg can legitimately field nobody. That is the trade the owner
   asked for, and it is the most likely thing to feel wrong.
2. **Doors 19-50 may read limp** after the ramp change. `RAMP.aimRange`
   is the knob; steepen it before touching `aimBase`.
3. **The archive spans modes.** Discovery is treated as a property of the
   player, so Rush Hour and The Tunnel share it. Unconfirmed with the
   owner; one line in `discoverData()` to reverse.
4. **`e.stageZ` bodies** (the man staged in a vault room) hold fire until
   the player is through the near doorway. The stall watchdog arms them if
   nothing happens for `LEG.stallAfter`, but that path has never been seen
   in real play.
5. **`LEG.stallAfter` is 4.5 s**, chosen from the shape of the problem
   rather than from play.

## The test harness — read this before writing a probe

`/tmp/claude-0/.../scratchpad/test`, 45 files, `bash runall.sh`. Serve with
`python3 -m http.server 8321` **from the repo root**; the server dies on
its own and a suite run then stalls mid-list looking like a hang — check
`curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' http://127.0.0.1:8321/index.html`
before diagnosing anything else. Chromium at `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium`,
`--no-sandbox`, viewport 402x874 `hasTouch`/`isMobile`. Always attach
`page.on('pageerror')`. Every file must print an `errors:` line — the
runner grades "did this reach the end" on it.

Traps that cost real time this session, all of them mine:

* **Wait on STATE, never on a clock.** Game time runs far slower than
  wall clock headless. Rates in world seconds via `__ts.worldClock()`.
* **Measure the subject, not a proxy.** A kill is `game.kills`, not
  `enemies.length` dropping — the corridor can add a body in the same
  window. Four separate red files came from this one habit.
* **Never assert against the constant under test.** "held at 75%" passed
  at 0.248 when the threshold moved; "13 m" passed over 3.39 m bodies.
  Write the spec number out, and add a second assertion that the code
  still asks for it.
* **`isFinite(null)` is `true`.** It coerces to 0. A body never visible
  from the walked path sailed through an "is it visible" check.
* **Sample at the moment the rule applies.** First-sight distance measured
  from wherever the loop noticed a body reported 4.6 m for men placed
  correctly at spawn.
* **`__ts.crossDoor()` teleports to `door.z + 2.5`** — two metres closer
  than a real crossing, which hides the dead-room bug entirely (0/30).
* Synthetic `.click()` does nothing on overlay buttons; use
  `page.touchscreen.tap` on a `boundingBox()`.
* `playerFire` aims via `camera.getWorldDirection`, and the camera takes
  yaw from the player in the frame loop — give it ~4 frames.
* A section needing a different world than its file gets its own file:
  `stall.js` (own browser), `dodgefire.js` (cleared profile, so the
  training legs actually exist).

Checks before any commit: `node --input-type=module --check < src/main.js`,
and `grep -oE "^function ([A-Za-z0-9_]+)\(" src/main.js | sort | uniq -c |
awk '$1>1'` for duplicate definitions.

## Standing lesson

Three separate times this session a change of mine was correct in the
small and wrong in the large, and the tests caught it only because they
measured the player's experience rather than the code's intent: `holdZ`
was gated on `finale`, and fixing `finale` would have silently switched
enemy advance on across the whole game; NEW RUN was "fixed" twice without
ever starting a run; the archive was per-save when the player thinks of it
as theirs. When a behavioural change makes several unrelated tests fail in
different ways, the tests are usually right and the change has a reach
nobody intended.
