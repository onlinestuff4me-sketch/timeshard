// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE ONBOARDING, AS DATA
//
// The specification this implements is docs/TUTORIAL-GOALS.md. Its four rules,
// because every line below is downstream of them:
//
//   1. one lesson at a time
//   2. the message stays until the lesson is COMPLETE
//   3. nothing on screen that does not serve the lesson
//   4. the next area opens on success, never on a clock
//
// The SHAPE of the lesson lives here; the MACHINERY lives in main.js. This
// module says which legs get built and what shape they are, what the player is
// allowed to do on each step, and what words appear where and on which beat.
// main.js says what "reached the corner" means and how a barrier sinks.
//
// tool/ imports this file directly, which is the point: what the level tool
// edits is what the game runs, so a preview cannot lie. Same property
// src/genleg.js has for corridors.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// --- the numbers -----------------------------------------------------------
import { planToCells } from './genleg.js';

export const TUTOR = {
  hallCells: 7,         // default straight cells, when a leg does not say
  // CLOSE ENOUGH TO SEE FROM THE CORNER. At six cells past the rejoin the
  // barrier stood 56 m from the last turn, which on a phone is a corridor
  // fading to white — so it and its sign appeared out of nothing half way
  // down the straight instead of being the thing you turn the corner and see.
  // ...AND A COUPLE OF CELLS NEARER THAN IT WAS. This counts from the last
  // CORNER now — with the fork gone there is no rejoin to count from — and
  // the old arrangement put the barrier eight cells past it, 32 m of straight.
  // Two cells nearer is 24 m: still a walk, still small and far off when they
  // turn the corner and see it, which is what makes it a place rather than an
  // announcement. (Two cells flat measured 8 m, which is not a walk at all.)
  barrierCells: 5,      // cells from the last corner to the barrier
  barrierH: 1.05,       // low enough to see and shoot over
  standWithin: 2.6,     // metres from the barrier that counts as standing at it
  // FOUR, NOT FIVE. At five the gunner stood twenty metres past the barrier,
  // which on a portrait phone is a figure a centimetre tall firing a round the
  // player has to be told is there. Close enough to read the arm going up.
  // HOW FAR BEFORE THE FIRST CORNER THE LOOKING LESSON STARTS. In cells, so a
  // path edit in the tool cannot strand it. Eight metres — a shade more than
  // EARLY.wayLookM, so the words land just before the needle begins to turn.
  lookLeadCells: 2,
  enemyCells: 4,        // cells beyond the barrier the first gunner stands
  enemyX: 1.15,         // ...and how far to either side the other two stand.
                        // A one-cell leg is 4 m of cell less 0.3 m of wall each
                        // side: 3.4 m of floor, so ±1.7 IS the wall and a body
                        // placed there is inside it.
  // ROUNDS HERE ARE ORDINARY ROUNDS — same speed in both clocks as every other
  // round in the game, because a tutorial that teaches a slower bullet than the
  // game fires has taught the wrong timing. What makes the first one fair is
  // not a handicap, it is that the world STOPS on the telegraph until the
  // player has read the prompt and pressed the button.
  aimBeat: 1.2,         // seconds from the enemy appearing to his arm rising
  // THE FREEZE LANDS ON THE ROUND, NOT ON THE ARM. It used to stop the world
  // part-way through the telegraph, so the words said DODGE THE BULLET with no
  // bullet anywhere on the screen: the player was asked to dodge a thing they
  // had never seen. He fires first, the round clears the muzzle, and THEN the
  // world stops — with the thing they have to get out of the way of hanging in
  // the air in front of them.
  // Not a third — nearly half. At a third the round is still inside the
  // gunner's silhouette, so the ring that names it reads as "this man" rather
  // than "this bullet". Clear of him, it is unmistakably a separate thing
  // hanging in the air, with eight metres still to come.
  freezeAfter: 0.45,    // of the way from the muzzle to the player
  // ...AND IT SETTLES INTO THE STOP RATHER THAN HITTING IT. The freeze used
  // to set the world's clock to zero on one frame, which took the bullet-time
  // zoom with it — the FOV is read straight off `timeScale` — so the lesson
  // opened with a jolt. Eased to a standstill over about half a second, and
  // then clamped to a true zero so nothing creeps while the player reads the
  // prompt. The round keeps travelling while it slows; see the harness note
  // on where it ends up.
  // 4/s: nine tenths of the way to a standstill in 0.58 s and a true zero by
  // about 1.2, against the single frame it used to take. Slower than this and
  // the stop stops reading as a stop; faster and the lens snap comes back.
  holdEase: 4,          // 1/s toward a dead stop once the freeze is called
  // ...and once they let it go, it travels at a pace a person can read. The
  // ordinary rule is that time moves when YOU move (0.05 standing still), and
  // at that rate a round twelve metres out takes half a minute to arrive: on
  // the beat that teaches dodging, the bullet did not appear to move at all.
  // The floor lifts for the dodging lessons and the ordinary rule comes back
  // with the meter, which is the lesson that is about the cost of slow time.
  // HOW FAR SIDEWAYS COUNTS AS OUT OF THE WAY. The freeze in the dodge lesson
  // is released by MOVING, not by a button — the slow-time control does not
  // exist yet — so this is the whole answer to "have they done it".
  dodgeStepM: 0.85,

  // --- THE DEFERRED SLOW-TIME LESSONS --------------------------------------
  // Nothing in the shipped sequence reads anything below this line. It is the
  // machinery for teaching the time button and the meter, kept whole and kept
  // WIRED because that lesson is coming back — it is deferred past the
  // onboarding for now (docs/TUTORIAL-GOALS.md §5) and unlocks at a door
  // instead. When it returns it should be a data change, not an excavation.
  //
  // `DEFERRED` below holds the steps themselves, off the running order but in
  // the spec, so the tool lists them and `slowlesson.js` exercises them. That
  // is the difference between machinery that is kept and machinery that rots.
  dodgeScale: 0.18,     // floor on world speed while a taught round is in flight
  meterSecs: 7,         // meter: full to the knee, in seconds
  meterCrawlSecs: 70,   // ...and the rate below the knee
  meterKnee: 0.5,       // where the drain slows
  meterFloor: 0.25,     // how low the demo is ever allowed to take it
  resumeDelay: 1.6,     // beat between the meter appearing and the way out
  warnAt: 0.5,          // fraction of the TANK left that trips the reminder
  rampDrain: 0.5,       // multiplier on the bank's drain while a lesson runs
  volleyGap: 2.6,       // seconds between rounds in the three-round lesson
  // ...BUT ONCE THE ROUND IS PAST, THE BEAT IS SHORT. `volleyGap` also spaces
  // the FIRST shot of a beat, where the pause is doing work — the player has
  // just arrived and is reading. After a dodge they are standing there having
  // already done the thing, and 2.6 s of nothing reads as the lesson being
  // over. One second: long enough to see the round leave, short enough that
  // three of them are one exercise rather than three waits.
  //
  // 0.4, NOT 1.0, because this is the countdown BEFORE the telegraph and the
  // player is timing the round. Measured: the arm-raise adds ~0.6 s between
  // the beat ending and the round existing, so 0.4 puts the next bullet in
  // the air one second after the last one went past — which is the ask.
  // (It was 2.6, and with the telegraph that was 3.2 s of standing still.)
  dodgeGap: 0.4,
  // THE DODGE PROMPT, OUT IN THE TRAINING ROOMS. Lesson 5 teaches the dodge
  // against a round that is fired to be dodged; after the barrier the rooms
  // are real fights, and a player who has not internalised it just stands in
  // the lane and dies without ever learning why. So the lesson comes back —
  // for the FIRST round fired at him in an area, and only if that round is
  // still on course to hit when it is most of the way over. One round per
  // area, because a prompt that fires whenever somebody is in trouble is not
  // a rescue, it is a nag.
  //
  // 0.75, NOT 0.45 like the lesson's own freeze: this one interrupts a real
  // fight, so it waits as long as it can and still leave a quarter of the
  // flight to move in. Earlier and it stops the world over a round he was
  // already stepping out of.
  rescueAt: 0.75,       // fraction of the muzzle-to-player distance flown
  // 0.55 m = the player's 0.32 m radius and a graze. This is the answer to
  // "is he still in the path", so it has to mean the round would land; at the
  // metre it used to be, a bullet sailing past his shoulder brought up DODGE
  // THE BULLET and told a player who had just dodged that he had not.
  rescueLane: 0.55,     // metres off the round's line and still a threat
  // HOW FAR A SCRIPTED BODY WILL ENGAGE FROM. A gunner's engage radius is
  // rolled per spawn — 19 m plus up to 6 — and every retry deletes and
  // re-spawns the area's bodies, so every retry re-rolls it. The training
  // areas stand their lead man 5 cells in, which is 21.5 m from the door
  // plane the player actually walks through: above the 19 m floor and inside
  // the random band, so a measured 14 retries out of 30 came up under the
  // standing distance. Those rooms were dead FOREVER — a pinned body never
  // closes the gap, and `unstickHallEnemies` skips anything the script holds.
  //
  // A scripted body does not need a random radius. It cannot move, the script
  // decided where it stands, and turn-taking is enforced separately by
  // tutorTurnHolds() rather than by distance. So the script decides this too,
  // and it covers the deepest authored placement with room to spare. Measured
  // from the door plane the player walks through — which is 1.5 m behind the
  // leg's own spine[0], and most of why 5 cells came out at 21.5 m against a
  // 19 m floor — the worst is now 33.5 m: hall2's rear man and room1's, both
  // at z 8. (It was 42.9 m when the ramp ran to six areas and finished on a
  // corridor with a man ten cells down it.)
  engageM: 60,
  reshoot: 3.2,         // ...and the gap before a missed shot is retried
  // THE METER LESSON HAS A FLOOR. It empties at a readable rate to half, then
  // slows to a crawl, and never goes below a quarter: the player is being
  // taught that time is finite, not put in a hole they cannot climb out of
  // before anyone has told them how.
                        // this as full-to-EMPTY, so the half the player is
                        // being introduced to went in 3.5 s.

  gunRise: 0.6,         // seconds for the weapon to swing up into frame
  rampFireDelay: 0.9,   // beat after entering a ramp room before anyone fires
  // HALF PRICE WHILE THEY ARE STILL LEARNING. The ordinary drain empties a
  // full bank in ten seconds of frozen world, which in a training room is
  // about one fight — so a player using the button the way they have just been
  // taught to ran dry in the first room and spent the other five without it.
  // ...and where "it is running out" is worth saying out loud. HALF OF WHAT
  // THEY HAD WHEN THEY SLOWED TIME, not half of the bar: a wave starts with
  // `base` seconds against a bar drawn to `cap`, so the meter is ALREADY at
  // 50% on the frame it appears and a warning at half the bar would fire the
  // instant the button was pressed. Half the tank is what a player means by
  // half gone. The game's own `low` mark is the floor under it, so a tap on a
  // nearly-empty tank still gets warned.
  // NOTHING DEAD IN HERE. `dodgeRounds`, `faceRate` and `finalEnemies` used to
  // sit in this list, complete with sliders and help text in the tool, and not
  // one line of main.js read any of them: dragging "how many rounds must be
  // dodged" changed nothing at all. The real controls are `advance.need` on
  // the dodging step and `bodies` on each step, both of which the step editor
  // already has. Every key below IS read — see the greps in docs/TESTING.md.
};

// --- the legs --------------------------------------------------------------
// AUTHORED, not generated. "A straight run, then a jog left, then another"
// is a sequence of specific corners; a generator that produces
// something like it four times out of five is no use for a lesson whose whole
// point is that the player knows what is coming.
//
// `moves` reads as instructions — ['f', 7] is seven cells forward, ['r', 3]
// three to the right — because that is how the lesson is described. `extra`
// hangs cells off the spine: a fork's second lane, or the width of a room.
// Both are relative to the leg's own start.
//
// Anything past the end of this list is an ordinary generated leg, which is
// what the end of the tutorial looks like.

// The teaching leg's moves, named, so the steps can say "ends at the corner"
// instead of "ends at spine index 7" — and stay right when somebody makes the
// first hallway one cell longer in the tool.
// TWO JOGS, NOT THREE, AND NO FORK. A lateral run is TWO turns to the person
// walking it — one into it, one back onto the axis — so three of them is six
// turns before anybody has been handed a gun, over a hundred and sixteen
// metres of corridor. Two is four: left, right, left, right, and then the
// straight the barrier stands in. The fork went with the third: a second route
// that rejoins is one more thing to notice, and lessons 1-3 are about the two
// thumbs and nothing else.
// LEFT FIRST, AND SHORTER. A lateral run is TWO turns to the person walking it
// — one into it and one back onto the axis — so `['r', 3]` between two forward
// runs reads as "left, then right", and two of them is four turns.
//
// FOUR IS THE FLOOR, not a choice. An odd number needs the leg to FINISH on a
// lateral run, and the barrier cannot live on one: it is placed at a grid ROW
// and spans that row's width (see the placement in main.js), so a leg ending
// sideways puts the slab off the floor entirely — measured, at (12, 64) with
// no floor under it. The sign, the gunner's cells and the dodge lane make the
// same assumption. Three walking lessons also need three distinct end marks,
// and one jog cannot supply them. So: two jogs, both turning LEFT first, on
// the shortest runs that still leave room to walk.
//
// (The move letters do not match the turn the player feels. Measured off the
// build, `['r', N]` swings the camera +90 degrees, which is a LEFT turn in the
// yaw convention the whole HUD uses. The names say which way the corridor
// steps in the grid, not which way the head goes.)
const TEACH_MOVES = [
  ['f', 5],    // 1. MOVE — dead straight, nothing else on screen
  ['r', 3],    // 2. LOOK — turn left, and back right onto the axis
  ['f', 3],
  ['r', 3],    // 3. and once more, so the habit is not a one-off
  ['f', 13],   // 4-9. the barrier, the dodging, the shooting, the door
];
// --- marks: named cells on the walked path ---------------------------------
// DERIVED, NEVER TYPED. A mark is a place in the lesson — "the first corner",
// "where the fork rejoins" — and the level tool lets the path be redrawn. Held
// as literals they went stale the instant it was: redrawing the teaching leg
// in the tool left the barrier standing 24 m inside solid rock, with lesson 4
// waiting for the player to reach a cell the corridor no longer had and the
// STAND HERE sign gated off a spine index the leg no longer reached. Nothing
// on screen, no way forward, no error.
//
// So they are computed from the plan, every load, for every leg — which means
// a path edit cannot strand them and the tool needs no control for them.
// Where the path last changes direction, as a spine index. For a leg that
// ends on a straight this is the end of the last lateral run; for one that
// ends going sideways it is where that run begins.
